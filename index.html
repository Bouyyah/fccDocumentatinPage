                In this guide, we will examine the building blocks of React apps: elements and components. Once you
                master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.

                Introducing JSX
            </header>
            <p>
                It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to
                describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the
                full power of JavaScript.

                JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the next section. Below, you
                can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.

                Why JSX?
                React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are
                handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

                Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React
                separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back
                to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk
                might convince you otherwise.

                React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI
                inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.

                With that out of the way, let’s get started!

            <p>
                The react-dom package provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top
                level of your app and as an escape hatch to get outside of the React model if
                you need to. Most of your components should not need to use this module.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render">render()</a>
                    <p>
                        Render a React element into the DOM in the supplied container and return a reference to the
                        component (or returns null for stateless components).
                        If the React element was previously rendered into container, this will perform an update on it
                        and only mutate the DOM as necessary to reflect the latest React element.
                        If the optional callback is provided, it will be executed after the component is rendered or
                        updated.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate">hydrate()</a>
                    <p>
                        Same as render(), but is used to hydrate a container whose HTML contents were rendered by
                        ReactDOMServer. React will attempt to attach event listeners to the existing markup.

                        React expects that the rendered content is identical between the server and the client. It can
                        patch up differences in text content, but you should treat mismatches as bugs and fix them. In
                        development mode, React warns about mismatches during hydration. There are no guarantees that
                        attribute differences will be patched up in case of mismatches. This is important for
                        performance reasons because in most apps, mismatches are rare, and so validating all markup
                        would be prohibitively expensive.

                        If a single element’s attribute or text content is unavoidably different between the server and
                        the client (for example, a timestamp), you may silence the warning by adding
                        suppressHydrationWarning={true} to the element. It only works one level deep, and is intended to
                        be an escape hatch. Don’t overuse it. Unless it’s text content, React still won’t attempt to
                        patch it up, so it may remain inconsistent until future updates.

                        If you intentionally need to render something different on the server and the client, you can do
                        a two-pass rendering. Components that render something different on the client can read a state
                        variable like this.state.isClient, which you can set to true in componentDidMount(). This way
                        the initial render pass will render the same content as the server, avoiding mismatches, but an
                        additional pass will happen synchronously right after hydration. Note that this approach will
                        make your components slower because they have to render twice, so use it with caution.

                        Remember to be mindful of user experience on slow connections. The JavaScript code may load
                        significantly later than the initial HTML render, so if you render something different in the
                        client-only pass, the transition can be jarring. However, if executed well, it may be beneficial
                        to render a “shell” of the application on the server, and only show some of the extra widgets on
                        the client. To learn how to do this without getting the markup mismatch issues, refer to the
                        explanation in the previous paragraph.

                    <p>
                        Remove a mounted React component from the DOM and clean up its event handlers and state. If no
                        component was mounted in the container, calling this function does nothing. Returns true if a
                        component was unmounted and false if there was no component to unmount.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#finddomnode">findDOMNode()</a>
                    <p>
                        If this component has been mounted into the DOM, this returns the corresponding native browser
                        DOM element. This method is useful for reading values out of the DOM, such as form field values
                        and performing DOM measurements. In most cases, you can attach a ref to the DOM node and avoid
                        using findDOMNode at all.

                        When a component renders to null or false, findDOMNode returns null. When a component renders to
                        a string, findDOMNode returns a text DOM node containing that value. As of React 16, a component
                        may return a fragment with multiple children, in which case findDOMNode will return the DOM node
                        corresponding to the first non-empty child.

                        Creates a portal. Portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside
                        the hierarchy of the DOM component.

        <section class="main-section" id="Components_and_Props">
            <header>
                Components and Props
            </header>
            <p>
                Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions.
                They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing
                what should appear on the screen.
            </p>
            <h4>Function and Class Components</h4>
            <p>
                The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:
            <pre>
                    <code>
                        function Welcome(props) {
                            return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;;
                          }
                    </code>
                </pre>
            This function is a valid React component because it accepts a
            single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element.
            We call such components “function components”
            because they are literally JavaScript functions.You can al use an ES6 class to define a component:
            <pre>
                    <code>
                        class Welcome extends React.Component {
                            render() {
                              return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {this.props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;
                            }
                          }
                    </code>
                </pre>
            The above two components are equivalent from React’s point of view.
            </p>
            <h4>Rendering a Component</h4>
            <p>
                Previously, we only encountered React elements that represent DOM tags:
            <pre>
                    <code>
                        const element = &lt;div /&gt;;
                    </code>
                </pre>
            However, elements can also represent user-defined components:
            <pre>
                    <code>
                        const element = &lt;Welcome name="Sara" /&gt;;
                    </code>
                </pre>
            When React sees an element representing a user-defined component,
            it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”.
            For example, this code renders “Hello, Sara” on the page:
            <pre>
                     <code>
                        function Welcome(props) {
                            return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;;
                          }
                          
                          const element = &lt;Welcome name="Sara" /&gt;;
                          ReactDOM.render(
                            element,
                            document.getElementById('root')
                          );
                     </code>
                 </pre>
            <ul>
                Let’s recap what happens in this example:
                <li>We call ReactDOM.render() with the &lt;Welcome name="Sara" /&gt; element.</li>
                <li>React calls the Welcome component with {name: 'Sara'} as the props.</li>
                <li>Our Welcome component returns a &lt;h1&gt;Hello, Sara&lt;/h1&gt; element as the result.</li>
                <li>React DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match &lt;h1&gt;Hello, Sara&lt;/h1&gt;.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="State_and_Lifecycle">
            <header>
                State and Lifecycle
            </header>
            <p>Consider the ticking clock example from one of the previous sections.
                In Rendering Elements, we have only learned one way to update the UI.
                We call ReactDOM.render() to change the rendered output:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    function tick() {
                        const element = (
                            &lt;div&gt;
                            &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
                            &lt;h2&gt;It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;
                            &lt;/div&gt;
                        );
                        ReactDOM.render(
                          element,
                          document.getElementById('root')
                        );
                      }
                      
                      setInterval(tick, 1000);
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                In this section, we will learn how to make the Clock component truly reusable and encapsulated. It will
                set up its own timer and update itself every second.
                We can start by encapsulating how the clock looks:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    function Clock(props) {
                        return (
                            &lt;div&gt;
                            &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
                            &lt;h2&gt;It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;
                            &lt;/div&gt;
                        );
                      }
                      
                      function tick() {
                        ReactDOM.render(
                          <Clock date={new Date()} />,
                          document.getElementById('root')
                        );
                      }
                      
                      setInterval(tick, 1000);
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                However, it misses a crucial requirement: the fact that the Clock sets up a timer and updates the UI
                every second should be an implementation detail of the Clock.
                Ideally we want to write this once and have the Clock update itself:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    ReactDOM.render(
                        &lt;Clock /&gt;,
                          document.getElementById('root')
                    );
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                To implement this, we need to add “state” to the Clock component.
                State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.
            </p>
